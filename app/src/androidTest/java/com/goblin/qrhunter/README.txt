IMPORTANT NOTEs IN TESTING

Should test firebase folder with: firebase emulators:start -> then run the firebase folder for tests
(assuming firebase login is already in)

RUN THE UI FOLDER TESTS SEPERATELY WITHOUT FIREBASE -> as firebase might conflict with the robotium
solo user with an actual firebase user, causing issues with the profile tests.

If any issues when running, please email aswu@ualberta.ca for further explanation.
